3. **Run Pre-Implementation Review:**
   - Invoke the `pre-implementation-review` skill before writing tests, code, or scaffolding files for the selected task.
   - Use the review to identify reuse opportunities, extension points, shared styling primitives, validators, mappers, enum boundaries, or other abstractions that should be decided before implementation.
   - If the review changes the implementation boundary or reveals reusable work that should be tracked explicitly, update the current phase tasks in `plan.md` before continuing.
   - The adjusted tasks must reflect the chosen abstraction, ownership boundary, and any additional tests or consumer updates implied by that decision.

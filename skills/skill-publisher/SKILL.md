# Skill Publisher

This skill helps you maintain the integrity of official skills by automating the synchronization between the development `skills/` directory and the public-facing `published/` directory.

## Publishing Protocol

When a user asks you to "publish" or "sync" a skill, use the automated script:

```bash
python automate_publish.py <skill-name> <category> "<summary>" --bump <patch|minor|major>
```

### 1. Categories
Map the skill to its category in `published/`:
- `audit/`: Compliance, linting, review tools.
- `workflow/`: Project management, Conductor integrations.
- `utility/`: General tools, managers.

### 2. Validation Checklist (Manual)
Before running the script, ensure:
- [ ] `SKILL.md`: Correct frontmatter (name, description).
- [ ] `README.md`: Present and accurate.
- [ ] Tests: All tests in `tests/skills/` must pass.

### 3. Automated Actions
The `automate_publish.py` script will:
1. Increment the version in `skills/<skill-name>/metadata.json`.
2. Append the summary to `skills/<skill-name>/CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Recursively copy the source to `published/<category>/<skill-name>`.

## Finalize
Commit the changes with a clear message: `feat(published): sync skill '<skill-name>' to version <new-version>`.
